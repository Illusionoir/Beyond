            <h2>Chapter 2: Serpent's Fury</h2>
            <p>Edward and Steven were conversing with the ship's captain in the meeting room when, suddenly, all three froze. Their eyes widened, pupils shrinking in shock as a wave of murderous intent surged through the air, thick and chilling. It felt as if an immense, malevolent presence had materialized just outside, pressing down on them with an unearthly weight. Edward and Steven instinctively grabbed their weapons, racing outside. Meanwhile, the captain darted toward the ship’s bridge, where he could take command and assess the situation from the control center.</p>

<p>What unfolded before them was a scene straight out of a nightmare. The creature’s very presence was overpowering, a force so dark and oppressive that it could kill an ordinary person outright. Without a strong will—or the protection of a mental shield artifact—no one could hope to survive the sheer weight of its murderous aura. Many of the escorts had already lost their will to fight; most had gone completely mad, eyes vacant and minds shattered under the weight of the creature’s presence. The sight was so pitiful that the captain’s heart sank, realizing the depth of terror gripping his crew.</p>

<p>However, the warriors of the Lucas and Edward households stood firm, unshaken and resolute. There was no fear of death in their eyes—only a fierce determination. They had steeled themselves, ready to protect the ship at all costs, unyielding even in the face of certain doom.</p>

<p>The captain glanced toward Edward and Steven. Though both appeared calm and fearless, their eyes darted around, searching for any possible escape route. They were formidable warriors, yes, but also the patriarchs of two great households—they knew they couldn’t afford to fall here. Yet, as they surveyed the scene, a grim realization settled over them: there was no path to escape death’s tightening grip. There was no way to defeat such a calamity on the open sea.</p>

<p>But when Edward and Steven realized their own children were aboard, their resolve hardened. They would protect this ship—even if it cost them their lives. And so began a desperate battle of fury and sacrifice: the relentless wrath of the sea serpent against the fierce struggle of fragile humans. Only time would reveal which would prevail.</p>

<p>The serpent opened its massive jaws, a sinister shimmer of light gathering within. As the glow intensified, a complex magic circle formed before its mouth, radiating arcane energy. In the next instant, a massive blue beam erupted forth, surging toward the ship with terrifying speed.</p>

<p>“Unit 2, defense up!” the captain commanded, his voice sharp and unwavering.</p>

<p>In response, Unit 2, which consisted of mages, swiftly took their positions. Clad in black hooded robes that concealed their faces, each mage brandished a wand, their movements synchronized like a well-oiled machine. At the center stood the unhooded archmage in a regal purple robe.</p>

<p>With wands raised high, the mages chanted in unison:</p>

<p>भूमेरम्बुदेर्वायोश्च बन्धनशक्तिभिः, <br>
आवहामः वर्तूलं कवचं सर्वत्र स्थितम्। <br>
अनन्तमेजः, न आरम्भो न च समाप्तिः, <br>
रक्षतु सर्वतो विपत्तेः, यत्र कुत्रापि स्यात्।</p>

<p>वर्धतां कवचं महाबलसमन्वितम्, <br>
आवृत्य सर्वदिक्शः, दिने रात्रौ च। <br>
पूर्णे माने, वर्तूलस्य च बले, <br>
मा आगच्छतु हानिः, मा निकटं रिपुः।</p>

<p>―― सिद्धकवच!</p>

<p>A radiant mana barrier surged into existence, a shimmering dome that crackled with raw energy. The blue beam collided with it, a thunderous impact that sent shockwaves rippling through the air. But the barrier held firm, its strength undiminished by the serpent’s onslaught.</p>

<p>The mages, faces hidden in shadow, remained focused, their wands steady. The archmage’s gaze was unwavering, a faint smile of satisfaction tugging at his lips as the beam finally dissipated, leaving the barrier untouched.</p>

<p>The ship stood unscathed, shielded by the might of the mages’ combined power, their incantation a testament to their skill and resolve.</p>

<p>The serpent, now furious at being thwarted, let out an ear-splitting roar that sent waves crashing against the hull.</p>

<p>Edward and Steven, seasoned swordsmen and leaders of their respective households, wasted no time. With a single nod to each other, they moved in perfect sync, their instincts honed from years of fighting side by side.</p>

<p>“Steven, we need to draw its focus away from the ship!” Edward shouted, gripping his massive greatsword with both hands. The runes engraved along the blade’s length began to glow golden as he channeled his mana into it, the light intensifying until it engulfed his entire form.</p>

<p>Without another word, they launched themselves into the air, mana propelling them like human missiles toward the serpent, their blades blazing with mana as they aimed to divert the creature's wrath away from the vulnerable ship and its crew.</p>

<p>Edward swung his greatsword with devastating force, each strike leaving a trail of golden light in its wake. Meanwhile, Steven’s rapier moved with blinding speed, thrusting at the beast’s vulnerable spots, each strike crackling with electric mana.</p>

<p>It was a display of pure skill, their movements synchronized like a deadly dance, and for a moment, it seemed they were gaining the upper hand.</p>

<p>But the serpent, realizing it was cornered, let out a guttural growl, its eyes flashing a frigid blue. The temperature around them dropped abruptly as the serpent summoned its ice magic. A blast of icy wind erupted from its maw, and in an instant, shards of ice formed mid-air, hurtling towards the swordsmen like a storm of daggers.</p>

<p>Edward swung his greatsword in a wide arc, shattering the incoming shards, but not all of them. A large spike of ice slipped through his defense, piercing his side. He let out a gasp of pain, blood staining his armor as he struggled to stay airborne.</p>

<p>Steven wasn't faring much better. He dodged and weaved through the icy barrage, but a spike of ice found its mark, puncturing his left leg. Before he could react, the serpent's massive tail lashed out, striking him across the chest and sending him crashing into the sea with a sickening thud.</p>

<p>The sea was filled with the serpent's triumphant roar as it loomed over the battered swordsmen, its eyes gleaming with a cold, cruel light. Steven resurfaced, gasping for breath, while Edward struggled to stay afloat, his armor weighing him down.</p>

<p>They had given it their all, but the serpent’s overwhelming power and mastery of ice magic had left them gravely injured and on the brink of death. The ship's crew watched in horror, their champions falling one by one, as the sea serpent prepared to deliver the final blow.</p>
