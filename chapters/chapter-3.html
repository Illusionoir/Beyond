            <h2>Chapter 3 : The Breaking Point</h2>
          <p>Both Steven and Edward were heavily injured and completely drained of their mana reserves. The captain, though deeply shaken, maintained a composed demeanor and issued orders in a calm yet commanding voice. He instructed his men to rescue Steven and Edward and directed the mage unit to distract the serpent to ensure the success of the operation.</p>

<p>"Unit 4! Retrieve both lords from the sea! Unit 3, distract the serpent!"</p>

<p>The ship's security crew was divided into distinct units, each with specific roles. Unit 1 consisted of scouts and technicians responsible for reconnaissance, navigation, and ensuring the ship's proper functioning. Unit 2 comprised defensive mages tasked with protecting the vessel, while Unit 3 included offensive mages specialized in attack spells. Unit 4 was made up of swordsmen who handled close combat and general security. Each unit had 8 to 10 members and was led by a head who reported directly to the captain.</p>

<p>The warriors of both households joined forces with Unit 4 to assist in rescuing their lords. Each household's contingent comprised 8 to 10 swordsmen, led by knights loyal to their respective houses.</p>

<p>Since they were in the middle of the sea, the swordsmen had limited options. Their skills in swordsmanship and mana manipulation were not advanced enough to fight in the air. They were doing their best, but their efforts were not enough to change the course of the battle. They could only stand ready, prepared to respond to any danger that came too close, but they were well aware of the limitations of their abilities in this situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mages of Unit 2, realizing the need for a more focused offensive, began to reduce the diameter of the protective shield. This allowed Unit 3 to step in and engage the serpent more directly. The mages of Unit 3, highly skilled in the arts of attack magic, immediately formed intricate magic circles outside the shield. Their eyes burned with determination as they chanted in unison, weaving spells that rippled through the air.</p>

<p>“सूर्यस्य दाहकस्य हृदयेना,यत्र वह्निः प्रारब्धः तत्राङ्गारैः,अहम् आह्वयामि ज्वालां, तीक्ष्णां दीप्तिमतीं च,ज्वालाः उड्डीयन्तु, रात्रिं प्रज्वालयन्तु।<br>
अग्निसंस्काराः, मम आह्वानं शृणुत,तुम्हारा क्रोधः उत्थाय सर्वान् दहतु।अग्नेः शक्तिेन, अहं त्वां प्रेषयामि,तव रोषः इदंप्रति विध्वंसं जनयतु।<br>
――अग्निबाणः”</p>

<p>With a flash of light, they unleashed powerful fireballs, the intensity of the flames searing through the air towards the serpent. Each fireball exploded with a thunderous crack as it struck the creature's scales, but it was clear that the serpent's thick hide absorbed much of the damage. Still, the mages pressed on, firing one after another, determined to distract the beast and create an opening for their comrades to act.</p>

<p>The serpent, sensing the threat, let out a deafening roar. It retaliated, unleashing a barrage of sharp, icy lances toward the ship, each one crackling with cold energy. But the shield held firm, protecting the crew as the mages’ focused attacks forced the serpent to shift its attention. However, the defense mages were growing weary, and their mana reserves were depleting. The shield, once strong and impenetrable, began to weaken with each passing second, visibly flickering as the mages struggled to maintain its strength.</p>

<p>Seeing the weakening shield, the captain’s face twisted with concern. His normally composed demeanor cracked as unease gripped him. His eyes flickered from the flickering barrier to the sea serpent looming above. Every moment felt like an eternity as he silently prayed, "Hold... just a little longer." His crew, too, could feel the tension rise; their movements became more frantic as they prepared for the inevitable. The air was thick with anticipation, the weight of the situation pressing down on them.</p>

<p>But the captain and his crew weren’t the only ones who sensed the shield’s fragility. The serpent, ever watchful, had also recognized the weakening barrier. With a predatory gleam in its eyes, the serpent’s assault escalated, its eyes blazing with fury as it unleashed wave after wave of ice-infused lances, each one sharper and colder than the last. The air around the ship grew heavy with frost as the icy projectiles slammed into the shield, their jagged tips crackling with deadly energy.</p>

<p>The mages of Unit 2 could feel the strain in their bodies as they channeled every ounce of their remaining mana, struggling to keep the shield intact. But with each impact, the shield grew weaker, flickering like a dying flame. The serpent’s relentless assault threatened to tear through the last remnants of their defense. The captain clenched his fists, his teeth grinding in frustration, knowing that time was running out.</p>

<p>He glanced over at his men, who were focused on rescuing Steven and Edward from the sea. The swordsmen of Unit 4 had worked tirelessly, braving the perilous waters to bring the two lords back aboard. After a tense few moments, they were successful in retrieving them, but the sight was grim. Both Steven and Edward were in a dire state, their bodies battered and drained, and it was clear they needed immediate attention.</p>

<p>The captain's expression hardened as he saw the condition of the lords. There was no time to waste. His voice, though strained with worry, remained commanding as he ordered, "Unit 4, take the lords to the healing unit, now!" The swordsmen quickly obeyed, lifting the injured lords with utmost care.</p>

<p>As the captain’s attention was focused on watching his men carry the injured lords inside, he allowed himself a brief moment of relief. The warriors of Unit 4, along with the household knights, had managed to get Steven and Edward to safety. But just as the last of the men entered the healing unit with the lords, the captain was about to shift his focus back to the battle.</p>

<p>Before he could turn around, a sudden, deafening crack echoed through the air. His expression turned grim as he spun back toward the scene unfolding before him. The mages of Unit 2 lay sprawled on the deck, unconscious, their mana completely drained. Their shield had faltered, and now the situation was even more dire.</p>

<p>Unit 3, the offensive mages, continued to fire at the serpent, launching spells to deflect the oncoming icicle lances, but their efforts were futile. The serpent, sensing its opportunity, had launched a barrage of sharp, jagged ice lances at the ship. The air was filled with the crackling hiss of ice as the lances tore through the atmosphere, threatening to shatter the vessel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the swordsmen channeled their mana into their swords, forming shimmering sword auras as they stood ready to defend the ship. With precise strikes, they attempted to intercept the icy projectiles, deflecting and slicing through them to prevent damage to the ship.</p>

<p>The battle became chaos as several icicle lances pierced through the defenses, striking the defenders with deadly precision. Many of the men, unable to regain their footing, were struck down by the lances, their bodies falling to the cold, unforgiving deck. The air grew thick with the screams of the wounded and the clash of weapons against the serpent’s unyielding assault.</p>

<p>The captain’s heart sank as he witnessed the carnage. His men, brave and determined, were falling one by one, and he could do little but watch as the serpent’s fury seemed unrelenting.</p>
