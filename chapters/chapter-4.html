            <h2>Chapter 4 : The Awakening -I</h2>
          <p>As the ship fell apart under the serpent’s relentless assault, so did the hopes of everyone aboard. Both Edward and Steven were critically wounded, and their men—along with the ship’s escort crew—were falling one by one to the creature’s fury. The situation was beyond grave. There was nothing left but despair. The noblemen and merchants were paralyzed by sheer dread, their minds consumed by the terrifying reality of their fate.</p>

<p>They cowered like rats, even as they knew their deaths were inevitable. Yet, despite the certainty of their doom, they scrambled mindlessly, seeking refuge where none existed. The ship was engulfed in chaos, its once-mighty structure now reduced to a cacophony of splintering wood and terrified screams.</p>

<p>Both Thane and Valantine were in utter disbelief. Their heroes were at death’s door, and an existence far worse than death still loomed, tearing their ship apart. They hadn’t blinked once this whole time, frozen in sheer horror.</p>

<p>For the two 13-year-olds, this was beyond comprehension. None of it felt real—only an overwhelming nightmare from which they couldn’t wake. They were petrified.</p>

<p>“This… this can’t be true,” Thane muttered, his voice trembling with despair.<br>
“Yes… this must be a nightmare,” he whispered, gripping his head as if trying to force himself awake. His breaths came in short, ragged gasps, his fingers digging into his scalp.</p>

<p>Then, a hollow chuckle escaped his lips. It was quiet at first, but it grew—a broken, eerie laugh that carried no joy.<br>
“This surely… can’t be happening for real.” His voice wavered, a twisted smile creeping onto his face as his mind teetered on the edge.</p>

<p>But Thane couldn’t wake up. It felt too real to be a dream. Slowly, he realized that this was no nightmare—it was reality. His chest tightened, and for a moment, it felt like he couldn’t breathe. His mind raced, thoughts crashing together in a chaotic storm. His heart pounded in his ears, drowning out everything except the sound of the ship breaking and the screams of the dying.</p>

<p>Then, something inside him snapped. His breath quickened, his body trembling—but it wasn’t fear anymore. It was rage, pure and overwhelming. His mind, already on the edge, broke completely. There was no more thought, no more reason—just the need to fight.</p>

<p>His eyes glowed, shifting into an intense golden light, as if a lion’s fierce gaze had taken over him. It was the same light his father, Edward, once wielded—but it was darker, more primal. Thane’s light exuded raw, untamed strength, a wild, unrefined power laced with fury.</p>

<p>The air around him was thick with bloodlust, an energy so dense and erratic it caught the attention of both the ship’s captain and the serpent. The captain was baffled, unable to comprehend what was happening.</p>

<p>The serpent, sensing the imminent threat, immediately recognized the danger. Its mana reserves were nearly depleted, and it knew that if it didn’t eliminate the source of this overwhelming bloodlust, it would meet its end.</p>

<p>Valantine, her mind reeling, stood frozen in place. She watched in stunned silence, unable to process what was unfolding before her. She felt the shift deep within her core, a disturbance that made her vomit blood, but she couldn’t focus on it. What she was witnessing was beyond explanation.</p>

<p>The eerie golden energy around Thane began to take shape, forming into a black and gold armor, forged from the very rage and power now driving him. A black and gold sword, engraved with golden runes, materialized in his hands.</p>

<p>No longer the boy who had once stood beside her, Thane was transformed—covered in mysterious black and gold armor, wielding a massive greatsword with a black blade, golden rune engraved on it and golden hilt. Without a second thought, he leaped off the ship, charging straight at the serpent, ready to face it head-on.</p>

<p>The serpent reared back. Its eyes, filled with desperation and fury, locked onto him. It had to stop him now.<br>
With a piercing screech, the serpent unleashed a barrage of icicle lances. Each lance, sharp enough to impale solid steel, hurtled toward Thane in rapid succession.</p>

<p>But Thane didn’t flinch.<br>
His greatsword moved, the golden runes on its black blade pulsing with raw power. With effortless swings, he shattered the lances midair, reducing them to nothing more than shards of ice. One after another, he cut through the frozen projectiles, never slowing, never hesitating. The serpent’s attacks were useless.</p>

<p>And then, he closed the distance.</p>

<p>The serpent had no choice but to fight physically. It lunged forward, its massive fangs aiming for Thane, but he met it head-on. His greatsword slashed, carving deep into its scales. The beast thrashed, twisting its enormous body to slam him with its tail. The impact would have crushed any normal warrior, but Thane barely reacted. His sword swung again, splitting open the serpent’s flesh as it recoiled in pain.</p>

<p>The fight was relentless. Ice claws raked toward him, but he parried. The serpent’s tail lashed out once more, but he cut through it mid-motion, severing scales and flesh with ease.</p>

<p>The serpent’s eyes widened in desperation. It had no mana to waste. If it didn’t end this now, it would die.<br>
With a thunderous roar, the serpent made its decision. It coiled its massive body and summoned an ice storm by sacrificing itself. The sea beneath them trembled as the temperature plummeted.</p>

<p>The sea froze over in an instant. Ice burst from below, forming jagged spikes across the surface.<br>
It was nothing but an explosion of cold mana, freezing everything as it expanded in all directions. The temperature plummeted so rapidly that even the places untouched by the mana were already turning frigid. The people on the ship saw the explosion and felt the air grow deathly cold.</p>

<p>Valantine’s eyes widened as she noticed the oncoming wave of freezing mana, solidifying everything in its path. Nothing survived its touch—ice spread relentlessly, swallowing the battlefield.</p>

<p>But Thane stood there, completely unaffected. His armor shielded him, untouched by the deadly frost.</p>

<p>And then she realized it.<br>
<i>He’s not going to help us.</i><br>
Thane wasn’t controlling the power—the power was controlling Thane.</p>

<p>The captain, resigned to his fate, removed his cap and closed his eyes.<br>
“I’m sorry I couldn’t save you, my comrades... I’m coming, my love…”</p>

<p>As he was about to open his eyes, wondering why death hadn’t come quicker, an explosion of warmth filled the air.</p>

<p>A massive phoenix emerged from the explosion, its wings beating fiercely, repelling the cold mana, and saving the ship from its deadly embrace.<br>
The captain couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>

<p>And then, perched atop the magnificent creature, he saw her—Valantine.<br>
She was draped in shimmering red and blue armor, holding a rapier in her hand, her expression unwavering.</p>
