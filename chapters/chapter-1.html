            <h2>Chapter 1: The Sea: Voyage to Aequor</h2>
            <p>The ship was full of people, all talking and enjoying the view of the sunset from the ship. The wind carried the salty smell of the ocean, and the waves splashed against the side of the ship.  

Everyone was talking to each other with smiles on their faces, enjoying the setting sun over the sea—until…</p>



<p><strong>«Attention, passengers! We are currently entering an area of rough seas and turbulence. For your safety and comfort, we ask that all passengers move indoors and refrain from using outdoor areas until conditions improve.»</strong></p>

<p>Everyone’s face showed slight annoyance, but no one said anything. They calmly made their way inside.  

After all, everyone aboard this ship held a high status—whether nobles or wealthy merchants. Even though the ship had its own security crew, most nobles and merchants had brought along a small team of 5–10 highly skilled escorts.  

The noblemen and merchants went inside, while the escorts gathered with the ship's crew. They were all on high alert.</p>



<p>Seeing this scene, 13-year-old Thane Lucas was confused. He wondered what the escorts and ship's crew were doing and how they were so well-coordinated.</p>

<p>“Ah, since many noblemen and wealthy merchants board this ship, numerous business opportunities arise for deals and such. The sea route is filled with unseen dangers and mysteries, so they bring their own capable men to protect themselves.  

These men are highly skilled and experienced, so they know exactly what to do in situations like this.”</p>

<p>Without even needing to ask, Edward knew what was going on in his son’s mind and explained the situation to him.</p>

<p>“Wh-What dangers?” Thane asked, his eyes shining with excitement.</p>

<p>“Hahaha! You really are Lucas’s boy.” Steven Helford laughed heartily, unable to resist smiling at the boy's enthusiasm.  

Although Edward's face clearly showed worry, everyone present chose to ignore his concerns.</p>

<p>“I heard there are pirates in these waters,” Valentine Helford said, her beautiful voice carrying a hint of curiosity.</p>

<p>Both Thane and Valentine were strangely excited by the idea of danger on this route, almost as if they were ready to fend off any monsters or pirates and save the day.  

It was only natural, given that they came from great aristocratic families known for producing exceptional knights in every generation. And the fact that they were childhood best friends only fueled their eagerness.</p>

<p>Edward shot Steven a look that seemed to say, <i>“Heh, what will you say to that now?”</i>  

Steven had been amused by Thane's excitement, but when his own daughter Valentine also seemed eager for adventure, he wasn’t quite sure how to feel.  

Amusement mixed with a hint of concern flickered across his face as he struggled to find the right reaction.</p>

<p>The sea wasn't just plagued by storms and pirates; many sea beasts lurked beneath the surface. These creatures were the main reason why sea routes remained underdeveloped.  

A common person could never imagine venturing into the open sea, as the sea was nothing but a nightmare.</p>

<p>Everyone had gathered inside the ship’s cabins and halls, while the escorts and crew searched for a safe route. On the surface, everyone appeared calm, but beneath it all, the atmosphere was tense.</p>

<p>Unaware of the situation, both Thane and Valentine were curious to know what was happening outside.  

They both decided to sneak outside while their parents were speaking with the ship’s captain.</p>

<p>An eerie atmosphere surrounded them, leaving them confused—until the next moment, when their confusion turned into fear.</p>

<p>What they saw was a majestic blue silhouette shimmering under the moonlight.  

It was a massive sea serpent, its sleek, scaled body undulating gracefully above the water’s surface.  

The creature’s scales glistened like sapphires, each reflecting the moon’s glow in a mesmerizing dance of light.  

Its eyes, glowing like two pale lanterns, were fixed on the ship with a terrifying intensity, as if driven by a deep, unspoken grudge.  

Long, jagged fins ran down its spine, slicing through the air with every movement, while its jaws, lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth, parted slightly, as if ready to swallow the ship whole.</p>

<p>The very air around it seemed charged with a haunting energy, as though the sea itself resonated with its thirst for vengeance.  

The eerie sight sent shivers down their spines, turning their initial curiosity into pure, heart-pounding fear.</p>
